  <title>Rob Wettach - Hello World!</title>

  <h1>Hello World!</h1>

  <p>
    This is my first foray into actually building something for the Internet. I've been a software developer for nearly 7 years, but have always been distracted from actually building something for myself. I've always been excite about Apple products and recently <a href="https://swift.org/">Swift</a>. When I discovered that Swift was available for server-side development (something I have quite a lot of experience in with Java) via <a href="https://vapor.codes/">Vapor</a>, I figured it was worth a shot.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm going to follow a recommendation that I heard on the <a href="https://overcast.fm/+GCc6vVHhs">SwiftCoders</a> podcast and "learn in the open". I'm going to post all of my code to my <a href="https://github.com/robwettach/robwettach-com">GitHub</a> repo and blog about what I learn as I go (the ultimate goal is to build a personal site that includes a blog, so that will be a good start).
  </p>
  <h2>Work so far:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Installed <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12">Xcode 8</a></li>
    <li><code>curl -sL check.vapor.sh | bash</code></li>
    <li><code>curl -sL toolbox.vapor.sh | bash</code></li>
    <li><code>vapor new robwettach-com</code></li>
    <li>Deleted a whole bunch of files that I don't need yet.</li>
    <li>Wrote this HTML file.</li>
    <li>Created a super simple route on / to redirect to /index.html (Vapor reads files in Public if no route is found, but I'm not quite sure how to make a file named "/" or "".).</li>
    <li><code>vapor run</code></li>
  </ul>
